                    I grew up painting, doodling, and making illustrations. So when I got the chance of being a Graphic Designer,
                    I took it. I am passionate about design and am willing to work harder to reach my goals.
                    I have worked on a diverse range of projects including Logos, Branding, Social Media, Packagings, and Illustrations.
